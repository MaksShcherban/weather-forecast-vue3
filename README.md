# WeatherApp-vue3

This app is for a weather application that fetches weather data based on user input and displays the current weather conditions, as well as a forecast for the upcoming days. The application provides information such as temperature, location, wind speed, and an icon representing the weather conditions. Users can enter their desired location, and the application retrieves the corresponding weather data. The forecast section shows the predicted weather for the next few days, including high and low temperatures, and icons representing the weather conditions for each day. This allows users to stay informed about the weather conditions in their area and plan their activities accordingly.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
